			<ul>
				
				<p> {{no_of_questions}} questions follow, with 1 point each for every question answered correctly. No negative marking. </p><br>
				<p> Press the 'Submit' button as soon as you write your answer, less time taken means you are higher on the leaderboard. </p><br>
				<p> Every question has a timer of 30 seconds - exceeding which you will be redirected to the next question and the previous 
				question will be considered passed. </p><br>
				<p> You can 'pass' the question by pressing the Submit button, but you cannot return back to the question. </p><br>
				<p> Difference in cases will not matter (Correct answer: Dhoni, Answered: dhoni) will be considered correct. </p><br>

				<br>

				<p> This is a good time to maximise this window. </p>

				<br> 

				<p> If you are ready, the contest can be played <a href = "{% url 'play_contest' %}?contest_id={{contest_id}}&question_id={{question_id}}"> here. </a> </p><br>
